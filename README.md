# alpine-ghost-s3

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!** This is just a proof of concept.

This container is a simple example of how to deploy ghost using S3 as the storage backend and PostgreSQL as the database. Benefits:

1. S3 for file storage, no need to worry about having images stored in a container.
2. Database is an outside service configured by environment variables, making this more portable.
3. Built with Alpine Linux making this image about half the size of the community ghost image.

### Building
Clone the repo and build it using Docker:

```
git clone git@github.com:brint/alpine-ghost-s3.git
cd alpine-ghost-s3
docker build -t alpine-ghost-s3 .
```

### Running
Copy `docker.env.example` to `docker.env` and put in your values. Look at `config.js` to see what you can set via environment variable:

```
docker run --name ghost --env-file ./docker.env  -p 8080:2368 -it alpine-ghost-s3
```

Assuming all of your resources such as PostgreSQL and S3 are setup properly with the proper permissions, the output may look something like this:

```
$ docker run --name ghost --env-file ./docker.env  -p 8080:2368 -it alpine-ghost-s3

> ghost@0.7.9 start /
> node index

### Troubleshooting
Use the `-it` flags when launching the container to see the errors.

#### Database
If the database isn't properly configured (firewall rules, etc), the container will not start. Here's an example error:

```
$ docker run --name some-ghost --env-file ./docker.env  -p 8080:2368 -it alpine-ghost-s3

> ghost@0.7.9 start /
> node index

Knex:warning - Pool2 - Error: Pool was destroyed
Knex:Error Pool2 - Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432
Knex:Error Pool2 - Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:5432

ERROR: There is a problem with the database
 Pool was destroyed
```

#### S3
If you don't have the credentials, roles, or policies setup properly with S3, your error may look something like this:

```

```
ERROR: DeliveryError: Message delivery failed: 554 Message rejected: Email address is not verified.
```
